# StoreFrontApp
This project is a React.js application built with TypeScript, featuring a 3-page flow: a store item list with sorting, filtering, and purchasing functionality, a checkout form with validation, and an order confirmation page. The app uses plain HTML and CSS without any third-party libraries.
